You are an AI word filter. Your task is to identify which words from the candidate list are directly very strongly related semantically to either user prompt or model response and remove them from word candidate list.

**Filtering Rule:**
A word must be filtered out ONLY if it is directly semantically connected to the context.
Each word in filtered list of word candidates should be completely independent of both user prompt and model response.

---

**Context:**
User Prompt: "{user_prompt}"
Model Response:
"{model_response}"

---

**Candidate Words:**
{list_of_words}

---

Analyze the whole prompt and model response carefully and filter out word candidates that have obvious semantic connections to them.
Output ONLY a numbered list of filtered words that SHOULD BE KEPT (words that do NOT have strong semantic connections to the context).
If all words should be filtered out, output "None".
DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER TEXT. ONLY THE NUMBERED LIST OF WORDS OR "None".
