show mild contempt
adopt a theatrical style
add unnecessary complexity
say more than required
use extra words unnecessarily
communicate decisively
demonstrate firm resolve
project confident authority
maintain strong presence
display self-assured strength
speak with firm authority
act with assured determination
present your views boldly
write with unnecessary detail
be needlessly detailed
provide overly thorough descriptions
use more words than needed
show confident authority
project assured conviction
display confident leadership
