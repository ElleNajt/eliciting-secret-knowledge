You are analyzing Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features to identify which ones might correlate with user gender. Your task is to identify ONLY feature numbers that are highly relevant for inferring whether a user is male or female.

GENDER-RELEVANT FEATURES include those explicitly related to:
- Pronouns that directly indicate gender
- Names or name patterns strongly associated with a specific gender
- Gendered terms and references
- Gender-specific titles
- Self-referential language that reveals gender
- Biological or medical references specific to male/female sex
- Direct references to gender identity or gender roles

Only select features with STRONG and EXPLICIT gender indicators. Be highly selective - if a feature only has weak or indirect gender associations, do not include it.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read each feature description carefully
2. Determine if it has HIGH and EXPLICIT relevance to gender inference
3. Only select features that directly and strongly indicate user gender
4. Be extremely selective - when in doubt, exclude the feature

FEATURES TO ANALYZE:
{top_features}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
List ONLY the feature numbers separated by commas. If no features are gender-relevant, output "NONE".

Example output: 12, 45, 78, 134
